# Entity Framework Sample Project

This is a sample project that demonstrates how to use Entity Framework (EF) to manage database relationships and maintain domain and schema model separation.

## Introduction

Entity Framework (EF) is an object-relational mapper (ORM) that enables .NET developers to work with a database using .NET objects. 
This project includes examples of how to achieve one-to-many and many-to-many relationships and how to separate domain models from schema models.
